            <p>Itâ€™s a scientific fact that being in nature makes us happier and healthier. A quick escape to the woods is the ultimate form of medicine.</p>
            <p>We believe in living simply and sustainably. Our tiny cabins are completely off-grid, solar powered and ecologically responsible. Our culture teaches us that we never have enough. Eco systems embody harmony and balance. Trees grow to a height that reflects the nutrients and water immediately available. Squirrels store the right amount of food to get them through the winter. </p>
            <p>Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. It may even reduce mortality, according to scientists such as public health researchers Stamatakis and Mitchell.

I totally recommend this tour to anyone, thanks for a wonderful experience and we will be doing it again soon.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The hike was absolutely beautiful and the perfect level of difficulty. It was more rigorous than walking around a park, but I didn't feel like I was trekking the rain forest or something. It really was a nice little adventure in nature. Every winery he picked was beyond amazing. The staff were passionate and welcoming and really made us feel comfortable. No pushy sales people! Throughout the entire experience, Ken was able to keep the conversation going. Never a dull moment, full of laughs, and amazing memories. I couldn't have asked for a better tour guide. &rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;This was my six time on this hike and tour with Ken. He made me feel valued as a repeat customer, and switched up the path of the hike and some of the wineries from the last time I went. Ken is great at encouraging people through his hike, and keeps an excellent balance of stories and conversation mixed with silence to take in the beauty around us. He definitely took us to places we wouldnâ€™t know how to get on our own. Sharing a bottle of my family wine from behind a waterfall is definitely an experience I wonâ€™t forget. If youâ€™re on the fence about going on this adventure, take the leap! Take two leaps, in fact!&rdquo;</p>
